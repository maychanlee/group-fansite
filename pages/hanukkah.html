      <li>
        Hanukkah is an eight-day Jewish festival of lights celebrating the rededication of the Second Temple of
        Jerusalem and commemorating a miracle where a small amount of oil for the temple lamp lasted for eight days.
        It begins on the 25th day of the Hebrew month of Kislev, which falls between late November and December on the
        Gregorian calendar. Key traditions include lighting a nine-branched candelabra called a hanukkiah, eating
        foods fried in oil like latkes and sufganiyot, and playing the dreidel game.

      <h3>
        Rules of playing dreidel
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Spin the dreidel.</li>
        <li>The player performs an action based on the letter that lands face-up:</li>
        <li>Nun (נ): Nothing happens. It's the next player's turn.</li>
        <li>Gimmel (ג): The player takes everything in the pot.</li>
        <li>Hay (ה): The player takes half of the pieces in the pot. If there is an odd number, take half plus one.</li>
        <li>Shin (ש): The player must put one token into the pot.</li>
        <li>After your turn, the player to your left takes their turn.</li>
        <li>If you run out of tokens, you are out of the game (or you can ask for a loan of tokens from another player).
        </li>
        <li>The game ends when one player has all the tokens.</li>
      </ol>

        Recipe for Perfect Challah

      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine the water and sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over top. Set aside until foamy, about 8
          minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Put 1 cup of the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Whisk the honey olive oil, salt, egg
          yolks and 1 of the whole eggs in a small bowl until smooth, then pour into the well and stir to combine. Add
          the yeast mixture and remaining 3 cups flour and stir to make a soft, shaggy dough. Turn the dough out onto
          a floured surface and knead, adding more flour if needed, until soft and supple, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and
            let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for just a minute. Re-shape into a ball and
          return to the bowl. Cover and let rise again until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll and stretch each piece into a
          rope 12 to 15 inches long. Arrange 3 of the ropes side by side on a clean work surface and pinch the tops
          together. Braid the dough, pinching the ends together to seal when done. Tuck the top and bottom ends of the
          dough underneath and place the loaf on one of the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining 3 dough
          ropes. Cover the loaves with kitchen towels and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Whisk the remaining egg in a small bowl, then brush onto the loaves. Sprinkle with the poppy seeds, if
          using. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from front to back and top to bottom halfway through baking, until the
          bread is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 190 degrees F in the middle of the loaf, 22 to
          25 minutes. Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        <li>The bread can be served warm or at room temperature. Wrap the bread tightly and store in an airtight
          container for up to 1 week.</li>
