                    The celebration of New Year's is one of the oldest holidays still observed today! The earliest recorded festivities honoring the new year date back over 4,000 years to ancient Babylon. Back then, people celebrated in mid-March during the first new moon after the spring equinox, a time of planting crops and renewal.

                    The tradition of making New Year's resolutions also began with the ancient Babylonians. They would promise their gods to pay their debts and return borrowed items in hopes of earning good favor for the coming year. Today, people around the world continue this tradition, setting personal goals for self-improvement and fresh starts.

                    Ever wondered why we count down to midnight? The practice became popular in the early 20th century, especially after the first New Year's Eve ball drop in Times Square, New York City, in 1907. The sparkling ball originally weighed 700 pounds and was made of iron and wood, quite different from the glittering, high-tech sphere that drops today!
